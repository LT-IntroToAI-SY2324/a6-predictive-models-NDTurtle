# Project - Create your own predictive model

Predictive models are used across industries to analyze and make predictions about data. From sports to beauty products to app usage, predictive models provide individuals and businesses with data to make informed decisions.

Throughout this module, you have learned how to program both supervised and unsupervised learning models. In this final project, you will create your own! Throughout this project, you will work through activities to complete the following steps:

1. Choose a dataset.
2. Determine which algorithm is the best fit. Based on the dataset you choose, you will need to figure out which algorithm to use. This will require you to get to know your data and your goals! Is there a linear correlation between variables? Are you looking for numerical value or a label/category? Do you know the labels or do you need the model to create them for you?
- Do some tests with matplotlib and visualize your data.  Does it provide a good correlation?  Why or why not?
3. Program your model. Once you have chosen your type of model, itâ€™s time to create it! In this step, you will write a program that fits your chosen model to the data. Your program and output will be specific to the model you choose.  
4. Analyze and present your findings. An important part of creating predictive models is being able to communicate the results. In this final step of the project, you will present your findings using slides or an infographic. Your product should include the following components:
- Your reasoning for the algorithm you chose: I used the k means algorithm, since I didn't know the outcome I was looking for. 
- An explanation and analysis of the output of your model: What results did your model produce? What do they mean? The x values are clustered on one side, while the y values (being traffic volume) cover nearly the entire graph. This means that the traffic volume was a lot more variable than the temperature. 
- A prediction based on your model If temperature is -1.61 K (standardized), traffic volume will be 0.5300 (standardized)
- A summary of the accuracy of your model I'm unsure of the accuracy, as there is no r squared value for a k means algoritm 
- Real world implications. This model demonstrates that at certain temperatures drivers are more likely to be out on the road and this could be used to predict traffic.
